  title: Simple Sinatra ActiveRecord App with Migrations
  categories: [sinatra]
---
<p>I make a lot of stuff using Ruby on Rails, so why bother with Sinatra?  Well, its fast, has a very small footprint, and it&#8217;s fun.</p>
<p>I decided to build a simple posting app as a test for Sinatra. My example doesn&#8217;t do much, but it was fun to learn about all the little parts of Rails that I take for granted everyday. <br />
The first thing I did was start with the hello world example.</p>

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
require 'rubygems'
require 'sinatra'
get '/' do
"This is my first Sinatra test."
end
{% endhighlight %}

<p>I fired up the server</p>

{% highlight console %}
ruby test.rb
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Cool.</p>
<p>I really like Haml, so I created a file test/views/index.haml</p>

{% highlight haml %}
%h1 This is my first Sinatra test.
{% endhighlight %}

<p>and edited my hello world code:</p>

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
require 'rubygems'
require 'sinatra'
require 'haml'
get '/' do
  haml :index
end
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Fired up the server and once again was justified in my simple attempts. Cool, what about databases?  We all know and love ActiveRecord, so lets start there.</p>

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
require 'rubygems'
require 'sinatra'
require 'haml'
require 'active_record'

ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(
  :adapter => 'sqlite3',
  :dbfile =>  'db/test.sqlite3.db'
)

#Models
class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
end

get '/' do
 @posts = Post.all
 haml :index
end

#Posts
get '/posts' do
  @posts = Post.all
  haml :'posts/index'
end

get '/posts/new' do
  @post = Post.new
  haml :'posts/new'
end

post '/posts' do
  @post = Post.new(params[:post])
  if @post.save
    redirect "/posts/#{@post.id}"
  else
    "There was a problem saving that..."
  end
end

get '/posts/:id' do
  @post = Post.find(params[:id])
  haml :'posts/show'
end
{% endhighlight %}

<p>This will work, if you manually create your own database in sqlite. But I really like migrations. So I created a Rakefile.</p>

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
namespace :db do
  task :environment do
    require 'active_record'
    ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection :adapter => 'sqlite3', :dbfile =>  'db/test.sqlite3.db'
  end

  desc "Migrate the database"
  task(:migrate => :environment) do
    ActiveRecord::Base.logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)
    ActiveRecord::Migration.verbose = true
    ActiveRecord::Migrator.migrate("db/migrate")
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

<p>You have to manually create your migration file in db/migrations, and when you run rake db:migrate this rakefile will work for you.  Of course, you will have to edit this particular one to use a different database other than sqlite.  Perhaps you could create a configuration file using <span class="caps">YAML</span>?</p>
<p>You can see where this is going.  Sinatra is very lightweight, yet it gives you the elements that you are used to in Rails. If you wanted to use something other than ActiveRecord, you can go ahead and do that easily.  Don&#8217;t like Migrations? Don&#8217;t use them.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be using it, and keeping it in my toolbelt.  Try it out, it&#8217;s refreshingly simple if you spend your days toiling around in Rails.</p>
<p>I did some minor cleanup on the above code and threw it on my <a href="http://github.com/bbwharris/examples/tree/master/sinatra/test/">github which you can get here</a>.</p>
