  title: Heroku Gem Gone After Push
  categories: [heroku]
---
<p>I recently deployed to heroku and was greeted with the dreaded &#8220;App Crashed&#8221; dialogue.  In this particular case it was for a higher traffic production site, so I was frantic to fix it.<br />
A quick</p>

{% highlight console %}
heroku logs
{% endhighlight %}

<p>showed that the memcache gem was missing.  I scratched my head a little bit and did a quick git log on the .gem file.  It hadn&#8217;t changed in months.  Time was ticking, so I looked up the current version that I needed for the environment and I added it in.  Another git push and I waited.<br />
All the gems were pulled in and the instance started successfully.  In my haste to move on to the next task, I didn&#8217;t follow up too much and just assumed that this was a fluke.</p>
<p>It happened again, this time to a much less important application.  Only it was a different gem.  I took the time a looked through the heroku gem command list look for something like heroku rake gems:refresh or similar.  Nothing!  This seems like a very logical task.  The only way I can think to force a gem refresh is to edit the .gems file and perform a push.</p>
<p>I this case, that is what I did again.  I am not currently running on the bamboo stack, and this looks like it is a new phenomenon.  Has anyone else experience this oddity?  If I find a fix, I will post back here.  Maybe I need to get moving on upgrading to the bamboo stack&#8230;</p>
<p>To be continued.</p>
<p><strong>Update 10/03/2010</strong></p>
<p>I spoke with a local heroku developer and the issue that I experienced along with several others was caused by an error in the slug compiler.  A fix has been released and this issue should be resolved.  If you do experience it, simply touching the .gems file and committing will result in a slug recompile.</p>
