<p>Now that <a href="http://e-texteditor.com/">e &#8211; text editor</a> has been opened up, I am anxious to see it running on linux.  It looks like there is some activity on <a href="http://github.com/etexteditor">github</a>.  I cloned it myself and will be tinkering with it.</p>
<p>A lot of people will say, &#8220;Who needs another editor? Use Vim or Emacs.&#8221;  I personally prefer the cramped finger inducing keystrokes of Emacs, but I am always willing to play around in another editor.  I found TextMate to have a very fluid feeling that a lot of editors seem to be missing, the drawback is that I am not willing to pay Apple premiums so I can run TextMate.  Macs are great, but I am far too frugal to spend the money on one.  I am also irritated by The TextMate developers approach to their precious editor.  I can understand the Mac-only rationality from a small business perspective, but their entire approach reeks of Apple fanboyism.  I am willing to wager that a lot of linux developers would pay for TextMate, I know that I would.  Alas, I am resolved to search for alternatives.</p>
<p>I spent some time using Gedit, which can be setup to be <a href="http://grigio.org/pimp_my_gedit_was_textmate_linux">TextMate-like</a>.  I liked that environment, but I was instinctively pulled back to emacs.  Muscle memory is a terrible beast to overcome.</p>
<p>My hopes are high for e.  At the very least it is nice to watch the simple editor world evolve.  Now I am off to play with the e source code.</p>
