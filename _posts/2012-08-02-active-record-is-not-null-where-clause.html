  title: "Active Record Is Not Null In Where Clause"

<p>I had a difficult time finding out how to do this the way I wanted. Let's say you want to do a check for a value not being null along with other logic, say an IN clause. You're led down a path of forumulating a string that gets hairy</p>

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
  ids = [1,2,3]
  SomeRecord.where("some_column is not null and id in (#{ids.join(','})")
{% endhighlight %}

<p>That's kind of gross. I've done it, and I've seen it done. This is just a trivial example, if you have more conditions you can be tempted to expand that string. However, there is a cleaner way.</p>

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
  ids = [1,2,3]
  SomeRecord.where('some_column is not null').where(:id => ids)
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Much nicer use of chaining and AREL.</p>
