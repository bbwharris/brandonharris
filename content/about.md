I am a **VP of Engineering at Cloudflare**, where I lead engineering teams building critical infrastructure at global scale. My work focuses on balancing security, reliability, and performance for systems that serve millions of requests per second.

## Leadership Philosophy

As a leader, I coach growth and autonomy. I enjoy collaborating and solving difficult technical and organizational challenges. My approach centers on building autonomous teams that can operate effectively at scale while maintaining strong alignment with business objectives.

## Cloudflare & CISA Secure-By-Design

I recently authored a post on the [Cloudflare Blog](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-delivers-on-commitment-to-cisa/) about our commitment to the CISA Secure-By-Design pledge:

> *"As cyber threats continue to exploit systemic vulnerabilities in widely used technologies, the United States Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA) produced best practices for the technology industry with their Secure-by-Design pledge. Cloudflare proudly signed this pledge on May 8, 2024, reinforcing our commitment to creating resilient systems where security is not just a feature, but a foundational principle."*

The post details our automated kernel patching processes and the tooling we've built to ensure security updates are deployed consistently across our global infrastructure.
