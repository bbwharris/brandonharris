## [Cloudflare & CISA Secure-By-Design](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-delivers-on-commitment-to-cisa/)

I authored a post on the [Cloudflare Blog](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-delivers-on-commitment-to-cisa/) about our commitment to the CISA Secure-By-Design pledge:

> *"As cyber threats continue to exploit systemic vulnerabilities in widely used technologies, the United States Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA) produced best practices for the technology industry with their Secure-by-Design pledge. Cloudflare proudly signed this pledge on May 8, 2024, reinforcing our commitment to creating resilient systems where security is not just a feature, but a foundational principle."*

The post details our automated kernel patching processes and the tooling we've built to ensure security updates are deployed consistently across our global infrastructure.
