Welcome. I'm Brandon Harris, VP of Engineering at Cloudflare.

I lead engineering teams building infrastructure at global scale. My focus is on security, reliability, and performance—systems that serve millions of requests per second.

This site contains my thoughts on engineering leadership and links to my writing on the [Cloudflare Blog](https://blog.cloudflare.com/author/brandon-harris/).

## Projects

- **[Incident Response Simulator](/incident-simulator/)** - An interactive simulation where you act as Incident Commander during a critical P0 incident. Built with Cloudflare Workers, Agents SDK, and React.
