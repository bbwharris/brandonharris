## 🌐 Connection Info

Simple card based layout showing information about your current network. I was traveling and checking to see which Cloudflare point of presence I was connecting to from different networks: airports, hotels, coffee shop wifi. I realized all of this information is trivial to extract from a worker, so asked AI to build this simple page. Simple and obvious, but has been useful and something I've returned to several times.

### Technology Stack

This is built with:
- **Cloudflare Workers**: Edge computing platform
