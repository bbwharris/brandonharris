## 🚨 Experience Incident Response Firsthand

Step into the role of an Incident Commander during a critical P0 incident! This interactive simulation puts you in charge of responding to a kernel vulnerability affecting hundreds of servers and millions of requests per second.

### Technology Stack

This simulator is built with:
- **Cloudflare Workers**: Edge computing platform
- **Cloudflare Agents SDK**: Stateful WebSocket connections with Durable Objects
- **Workers AI**: Llama 3.1 for the AI assistant
- **React**: Interactive terminal-style UI
- **SQLite**: Persistent state management

### Source Code

The simulator is open source, and was an AI orchestration. You can view the implementation on [GitHub](https://github.com/bbwharris/brandonharris/tree/main/workers/incident-simulator).


### Disclosure

This simulation is _inspired_ by real incidents. This was a fun experiment to demonstrate several Cloudflare Developer Platform technologies together. It is not representative of an actual incident or event, and is purely fictional. Any similarity to an incident or actual events is coincidental. Commands, naming of things, have been simplified and generalized in the "interface". If you were really the incident commander you would be coordinating this effort and not executing these commands. It is just for fun.
