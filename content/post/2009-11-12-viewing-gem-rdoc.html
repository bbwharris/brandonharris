<p>This is painfully obvious if you actually read about the tools that you use.  I couldn&#8217;t find anything on my first couple of google searches, so hopefully this can fill in that gap:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">
gem server
</code></pre>

<p>Your gem server will probably start on port 8808, so go to localhost:8808 and you will see a list of your installed gems.  From here on, you probably know what to do.</p>
