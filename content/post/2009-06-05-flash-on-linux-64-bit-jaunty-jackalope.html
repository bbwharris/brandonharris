title: Flash on Linux 64 bit (Jaunty Jackalope)

<p>For me, Flash support has been an achilles heel on my 64 bit install.  I don&#8217;t want to use wrapper and work arounds.  I also think that if I have a 64 bit processor, I should be using it.</p>
<p>I found this little <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=772490">nugget</a> which works very well for me.  Flash drops out very rarely, previously it would work after 3 refreshes.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope that the next Adobe Flash update provides proper support to us linux users.</p>
