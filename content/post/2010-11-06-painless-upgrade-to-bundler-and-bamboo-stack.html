title: Painless Upgrade to Bundler and Bamboo Stack

<p>I just upgraded this site to use bundler and the heroku Bamboo stack.</p>
<p>The steps were:</p>
<p>1. Remove the .gems file, and create a Gemfile.<br />
2. <a href="http://gembundler.com/rails23.html">Patch the Rails 2.3 installation for bundler</a><br />
3. Run heroku command:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">
heroku stack:migrate bamboo-ree-1.8.7
</code></pre>

<p>4.Run command:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">
bundle install
</code></pre>

<p>5. Commit all changes to git, and push to heroku.</p>
<p>I am really impressed with the ease at which this was done.  Heroku continues to impress, and Bundler is the best thing to happen to Ruby since Rails.</p>
