<p>I have been receiving a lot of comment spam.  I would say around 30 comments a day. I wanted to try the simplest option possible, so I created a hidden field in the comment form that only a bot would fill out.  This was working under the assumption that bots don&#8217;t read css.  This worked for a little while.</p>
<p>My spam had been reduced to under 10 comments a day, which was still high, but maintainable.  As time went on, it crept back up to 30 or more a day. The next step was <a href="http://recaptcha.com">recaptcha</a>, which was a breeze to set up.</p>
<p>For two days now, my comment spam has totalled a big goose egg. 0.</p>
