title: JSON Templates in Rails

<p>Sometimes, you just don't want to do call the "to_json" message on an object. It could be that the object has a lot of attributes, the json needs are very simple, or you simply don't like the default structure.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there is a very easy solution: JSON templates. This is built in, and you might have not even known it.</p>
<p>In my case, I wanted to plot a bunch of people and their locations on a map. I had the following model:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ruby">
class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
  # ...

  def geo_location
    [latitude,longitude].compact.join(",")
  end

  # ...
end
</code></pre>

<p>I have the following controller:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ruby">
class PeopleController < ApplicationController
  respond_to :html, :json

  def index
   @people = Person.find(:all)
   respond_with(@people)
  end
  # ...
end
</code></pre>

<p>Now, create index.json.erb.  I tried doing this with haml, but I really didn't like the way I had to handle the necessary whitespace.  Your call if you want to use it.</p>

<pre><code class="language-erb">
[
<%- @people.each do |p| %>
  {
    "id": "<%=p.id %>",
    "location": "<%= p.location %>"
  },
<% end %>
{}]
</code></pre>

<p> There is a wart, the trailing {}.  I didn't want to include any logic, as it would slow down this rather large dataset.  The whole reason I am doing it this way is for speed.  I have no need to display all the attribute data from the "people" table, I just need to plot a heat map. Suggestions are welcome, the side effect is that the last point that is attempted to be plotted, is ignored.</p>
