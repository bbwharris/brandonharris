<p>This is another of those excruciatingly easy tasks that isn&#8217;t well documented.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">
git format-patch sha1..sha2
</code></pre>

<p>Where sha1 is the older commit and sha2 is the newer commit.  This will create patches for each modified file between those commits.</p>
