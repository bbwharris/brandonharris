title: Why aren't you using Active Scaffold?

<p>I do a lot of work creating admin interfaces in rails.  A lot of it is redundant, so it would be nice to use a canned solution.  <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> has an admin interface built into every project.  This makes a developers life easier.</p>
<p>I thought &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it be nice to have a plugin that read all my table associations and provided a simple crud interface?&#8221;</p>
<p>That is exactly what <a href="http://activescaffold.com/">Active Scaffold</a> tries to be.</p>
<p>How cool is active scaffold?  Well, let&#8217;s pretend that we want to create the following tables:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ruby">
class CreatePeople < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def self.up
    create_table :people do |t|
      t.string :first_name, :last_name, :zip_code
      t.integer :title_id
      t.timestamps
    end
  #... and so on ...
  end  

class CreateTitles < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def self.up
    create_table :titles do |t|
     t.string :title
     t.timestamps
   end
end
</code></pre>
<p>Let's setup the following relationship in the Person model:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">
class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :title
end
</code></pre>
<p>We would have to write views for People and for Titles to create a robust and useful admin interface. With Active Scaffold you only have to do the following:</p>
<p>1. Include default javascript and active scaffold includes in the layout file:</p>
<p>2. Add the following to your people_controller and your title_controller respectively:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erb">
<%=javascript_include_tag :defaults %>
<%=active_scaffold_includes %>
</code></pre>

<p>And your done!  ActiveScaffold takes care of the rest.  The more skeptical among your are sneering right now, &#8220;what if I want to change the way the form is laid out, or what if I want to select a field from the title model instead of selecting an object&#8230;.&#8221;  You can do all of this with active scaffold and it isn&#8217;t super difficult.</p>
<p>To set the column order and have title appear as a drop down:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">
class TitlesController < ApplicationController
  active_scaffold :titles
end

class PeopleController < ApplicationController
  active_scaffold :people
end
</code></pre>

<p>I recently had a record that was nested inside another record (such as title is nested inside people here) that had more columns than the horizontal space allowed.  Since Active Scaffold uses ajax, a scrollbar wasn&#8217;t an option, so I found this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">
active_scaffold :nested do |config|
  config.subform.layout = :vertical
end
</code></pre>

<p>This sets this form vertical instead of horizontal in all forms that it belongs to. (That&#8217;s a mouthful).</p>
<p>Check it out, I am sure that you will find it useful.</p>
