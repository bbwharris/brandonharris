title: Haxe - An Interesting Path To Open Source Flash Programming

<p>I have my reservations about learning flash.  It is proprietary, bloated, and doesn&#8217;t work very well on linux 64bit.  However, there are a lot of rich web applications that need to be flash based. Youtube anyone?  I landed on <a href="http://haxe.org">haxe</a>.</p>

<p>I was slightly turned off by the fact that haxe can compile to javascript, flash, or Neko (which I am not familiar with).  However, what turned my on was that haxe compiled to swf is apparently faster than <span class="caps">AS3</span> compiled swf&#8217;s.  That argument is probably a good topic for another post, I will have to run some benchmarking.</p>

<p>The documentation on <a href="http://haxe.org">haxe.org</a> is pretty good. <a href="http://www.cactusflower.org/learning-flash-with-haxe#library">Here is a good tutorial</a> on getting started with flash and haxe.</p>

<p>Here is an example of drawing two circles in haxe:</p>
<pre><code class="language-haxe">
class Test {
  static function main() {
    var mc:flash.display.MovieClip = flash.Lib.current;
    //set the fill color
    mc.graphics.beginFill(0x000000);
    //draw a circle at x=50, y=50 with a radius of 25
    mc.graphics.drawCircle(50,50,25);
    //complete the fill routine
    mc.graphics.endFill();
    
    //set the fill color for the second circle
    mc.graphics.beginFill(0xefefef);
    //draw a circle at x=75,y=50 with a radius of 25
    mc.graphics.drawCircle(75,50,25);
    //complete the fill
    mc.graphics.endFill();
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The result is what you see below.</p>

<embed src="/files/test.swf" 
       bgcolor="#ffffff" 
       width="400" 
       height="300" 
       name="haxe" 
       quality="high" 
       align="middle" 
       allowScriptAccess="always" 
       type="application/x-shockwave-flash" 
       pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" 
/>

<p>You can see that it is pretty easy to read and understand.  If you follow the tutorial at <a href="http://www.cactusflower.org/learning-flash-with-haxe#library">cactusflower.org</a> you will create something a little more interactive.</p>

<p>My impression is that if you need to develop a flash app and would like to use Open Source tools, haxe is definitely an option.</p>
