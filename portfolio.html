    <p>The site was designed by <a href="http://www.shayisdale.com">Shay Isdale</a>. </p>
    <p>I incorporated the awesome design into a fresh Ruby on Rails install.  They have full control over the content images, and testimonials that appear on the site.<p>

    <p>Meredith needed some updates to her wordpress website.  She wanted particular articles to fly out into a nice looking popup, social icons and correct placement of a disclaimer.</p>
    <p>I love <a href="http://fancybox.net/">Fancybox</a> it is a very nice looking and lightweight lightbox.  The wordpress community has a few options for plugins, but I chose: <a href="http://blog.moskis.net/downloads/plugins/fancybox-for-wordpress/">Fancybox for Wordpress</a> as it had the level of configuration that I desired.</p>
    <p>The results came out great, and I hope to be doing more work for Meredith in the future</p>

    <p>This was an inherited project.  The client requested an activities feed, a five star rating, an index for the open water section of the site and several small changes. It was also requested to setup a staging site for future changes</p>
    <p>The site is hosted on <a href="http://www.slicehost.com">Slicehost</a> and during the updates, it became clear that the current slice could not support the traffic or the necessary resources.</p>
    <p>I updated the backend to use <a href="http://www.rubyenterpriseedition.com/">Ruby Enterprise Edition</a> with <a href="http://www.modrails.com/install.html">Nginx Passenger</a>.  The budget was tight so we had to squeeze every ounce out of the memory in the slice.  Nginx + REE delivered and greatly improved the speed of the site.</p>

    <p>I worked on the original interactive map for Kirk at a previous employer. After I left that position, Kirk contacted me to receive a referral for a Ruby on Rails developer. To our mutual luck, I  happened to be in a position to help him out myself.</p>
    <p>We redesigned the site with the help of <a href="http://shayisdale.com">Shay Isdale</a>.  The site was refocused as a portal for Texas Hill County Communities. There are many ideas still in development, I think that the end result will propel Kirk into the forefront of Texas Hill country agents.</p>
    <p>Kirk is a very amicable and down to earth guy, making him a great client to work with. I work with the guys at <a href="http://www.monsterweb.com">MonsterWeb</a> for hosting, and I have built the site using Ruby on Rails.  The map functionality is written in JQuery.</p>

    </p> 
    <p>Many upgrades will be done to the site, it was mutually decided that porting the site to Ruby on Rails would reduce the time to implement new features</p>
    <p>Site was ported and is hosted on the cloud at heroku</p>

    <p>Created two widgets for chat client and facebook group to allow more modularity on the site.</p>
    <p>Made adjustments to CSS to provide a more consistent feel on the site.  Improved SEO by optimizing home page and properly configuring SEO plugin.</p>
