    <p><a href="http://www.ticketbud.com">Ticketbud</a> is exactly what you should be using for your next event. It's a flat fee, custom ticketing solution. I worked closely with the ticketbud team to revamp and reprocess their application. It is beautiful and solves a pain point for event organizers everywhere. I rebuilt it from the ground up and have been working on many new exciting features. The front end work was done by <a href="http://upshawinteractive.com/">Upshaw Interactive</a>.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.swimtopia.com">SwimTopia</a> relieves a huge pain point for swim teams. It is an excellent application with a very talented group of people behind it. I was tasked to help build out the easy to use CMS interface for swim teams custom sites. I gained intimate knowledge of <a href="https://github.com/collectiveidea/awesome_nested_set">Awesome Nested Set</a>. I had a lot of fun, and hope to work with Swimtopia in the future, and wish them great success.</p>

      <a href="http://saritavalley.com">Sarita Valley</a> is a housing community in Leander, TX. <a href="http://riversideresources.com">Riverside Resources</a> designed the pleasant looking informational site. This site was built using <a href="http://middlemanapp.com">Middleman</a>, which I highly recommend over using plain html/css if you are used to building dynamic sites in a web framework like Ruby on Rails.

    <p>I am the 3rd developer to work on this site. It focuses on making Risk Assesment and Compliance a breeze for the banking industry. There are many, many rich features to be explored within this site. Reporting, complex email notifications, re-branding, inline editing, strict user permissions. I have so far accomplished upgrading the site to a more modern version of rails, as well as puting out fires, adding features, etc.</p>

    <p>Voters Act is a social donation platform. The founders are actively promoting, and growing the business. The design was done by <a href="http://shayisdale.com">Shay Isdale</a>. It is a very interesting idea and application, if you are a political junkie, I suggest you sign up and start fundraising for your favorite candidates.</p>

    <p>I built out and modified the entire SCAD database. CCAPS, Upstream, and myself worked closely on every detail of this website. It is a gem in the academic community.<p>

    <p>Meredith needed some updates to her wordpress website.  She wanted particular articles to fly out into a nice looking popup, social icons and correct placement of a disclaimer.</p>
    <p>I love <a href="http://fancybox.net/">Fancybox</a> it is a very nice looking and lightweight lightbox.  The wordpress community has a few options for plugins, but I chose: <a href="http://blog.moskis.net/downloads/plugins/fancybox-for-wordpress/">Fancybox for Wordpress</a> as it had the level of configuration that I desired.</p>
    <p>The results came out great, and I hope to be doing more work for Meredith in the future</p>

    <p>This was an inherited project.  The client requested an activities feed, a five star rating, an index for the open water section of the site and several small changes. It was also requested to setup a staging site for future changes</p>
    <p>The site is hosted on <a href="http://www.slicehost.com">Slicehost</a> and during the updates, it became clear that the current slice could not support the traffic or the necessary resources.</p>
    <p>I updated the backend to use <a href="http://www.rubyenterpriseedition.com/">Ruby Enterprise Edition</a> with <a href="http://www.modrails.com/install.html">Nginx Passenger</a>.  The budget was tight so we had to squeeze every ounce out of the memory in the slice.  Nginx + REE delivered and greatly improved the speed of the site.</p>

    </p> 
    <p>I worked on the original interactive map for Kirk at a previous employer. After I left that position, Kirk contacted me to receive a referral for a Ruby on Rails developer. To our mutual luck, I  happened to be in a position to help him out myself.</p>
    <p>We redesigned the site with the help of <a href="http://shayisdale.com">Shay Isdale</a>.  The site was refocused as a portal for Texas Hill County Communities. There are many ideas still in development, I think that the end result will propel Kirk into the forefront of Texas Hill country agents.</p>
    <p>Kirk is a very amicable and down to earth guy, making him a great client to work with. I work with the guys at <a href="http://www.monsterweb.com">MonsterWeb</a> for hosting, and I have built the site using Ruby on Rails.  The map functionality is written in JQuery.</p>

    <p>Many upgrades will be done to the site, it was mutually decided that porting the site to Ruby on Rails would reduce the time to implement new features</p>
    <p>Site was ported and is hosted on the cloud at heroku</p>
